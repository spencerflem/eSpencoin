TO RUN:
activate with conda:
`activate eSpencoin` (this is a note to my future self - you will need to first make a conda env)
then run the bot:
`python eSpencoin4.py`
enjoy!


Bot to send eSpencoin to members of a discord

Coins are stored as a string and placed into a role
Rolls are pooled if they are identical
Balances are strings that are symbolically resolved to a number
Balances have a real and imaginary component

To Those Looking At This Repository:
the important file is eSpencoin4.py
all others are short lived experiments or old versions
I undertand that this is not an example of proper git hygene
However, eSpencoin4 is (in my opinion) a well written and commented file
